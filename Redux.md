# Application State with Redux

## Redux
Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.

In this course, Dan Abramov will show you the fundamentals of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.

## What is Redux?
Redux takes away some of the hassles faced with state management in large applications. It provides you with a great developer experience, and makes sure that the testability of your app isn’t sacrificed for any of those.

As you develop React applications, you may find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient for you.

You may also have a lot of data changing in your application over time.

## Why use Redux?
As you already know, questions like “Why should you use A over B?” boil down to your personal preferences.

I have built apps in production that don’t use Redux. I’m sure that many have done the same.

For me, I was worried about introducing an extra layer of complexity for my team members. In case you’re wondering, I don’t regret the decision at all.

Redux’s author, Dan Abamov, also warns about the danger of introducing Redux too early into your application. You may not like Redux, and that is fair enough. I have friends who don’t.

That being said, there are still some very decent reasons to learn Redux.

For example, in larger apps with a lot of moving pieces, state management becomes a huge concern. Redux ticks that off quite well without performance concerns or trading off testability.

One other reason a lot of developers love Redux is the developer experience that comes with it. A lot of other tools have begun to do similar things, but big credits to Redux.

Some of the nice things you get with using Redux include logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay — all without doing so much on your end as the developer. These things will likely sound fancy until you use them and see for yourself.
