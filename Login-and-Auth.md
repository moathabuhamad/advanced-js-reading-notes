### Definition of Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network. As a result, lower-level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities. Using RBAC will help in securing your company’s sensitive data and important applications

### The designations in an RBAC tool can include
Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
Management role group – you can add and remove members.
Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

### BENEFITS OF RBAC
Reducing administrative work and IT support.
Maximizing operational efficiency.
Improving compliance.
