### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms).

A singleton is a software design pattern where the instantiation of a class is restricted to one "single" instance.

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes.

You can create a singleton class by creating a class with a private constructor and a get method which returns the one instance of the class. Then re-use that instance throughout your code.

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

Tbh I have no clue how to answer this.

### Vocabulary Terms

Router Middleware - Middleware that operates at the route level of an application.

Dynamic Module Loading - Loading modules into memory at run-time.

Singleton Pattern - a software design pattern where the instantiation of a class is restricted to one "single" instance.

CRUD -> REST Method Matches -    
Create -> Put/Post,   
Read -> Get,   
Update -> Put,   
Delete -> Delete

Mock Testing - Using a 'mock' to return an expected value and test how a function handles that value.
