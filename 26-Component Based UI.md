## What is the Difference Between a Framework and a Library?

Frameworks differ from libraries in their control flow. Libraries offer functions to be called by the parent code. Frameworks define the entire application design. Developers do not call a framework, the framework they use calls and uses their code in a particular way.

## Vocabulary Terms
| **Vocabulary Term** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Rendering** | *The transformation of HTML and other code into an interactive, visual representation (web page) within the browser on a user's device* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) |
| **Templates** | *Allow designers and developers to automatically generate custom web pages. They support static content, providing basic structure and appearance. They can be implemented from content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) |
| **State** | *A system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system. Similarly, a computer program stores data in variables, which represent storage locations in the computer's memory. The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution, is called the program's state.* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) |

## 3 Things I Had Previously Heard of and Now Have Better Clarity On

1. JSX is an extension of JavaScript commonly used with React for displaying data
1. React create objects known as *'React elements'* which describe what is desired to be displayed in the browser
1. React apps only update what is necessary when something changes

## 3 Things I Am Hoping to Learn More About in the Upcoming Lecture

1. How React DOM *'escapes'* any values embedded in JSX before rendering them to prevent injection attacks
1. How React DOM compares the element to previous ones in order to determine that an update is necessary
1. State and stateful components

## I Am Most Excited About Trying to Implement or See How These Work:

- All of React in general
