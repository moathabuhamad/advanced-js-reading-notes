### Big O: is a term used to describe the performance of an algorithm or function. 
### It considers two criteria:
### 1. Time Complexity
### 2. Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: How long does it take to complete the task? 
### Space Complexity: How much extra space does the process require? 
### As the input size grows, the Big-O notation displays the limit to show how much time or space an algorithm would require in the worst-case scenario.
