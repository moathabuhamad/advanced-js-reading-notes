## Big O
### Big O: is a term used to describe the performance of an algorithm or function. 
### It considers two criteria:
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: How long does it take to complete the task? 
### Space Complexity: How much extra space does the process require? 
### As the input size grows, the Big-O notation displays the limit to show how much time or space an algorithm would require in the worst-case scenario.

## Linked List
### A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is determined by their physical location in memory rather than by their physical order. Instead, each element serves as a stepping stone to the next. It's a data structure made up of a number of nodes that together form a sequence.
## Terms: 
- A linked list is a data structure with nodes that link to the next node in the list.
- Singly - Singly refers to the node's number of references. There is only one reference in a singly linked list, and the reference points to the next node in the linked list.
- Doubly - The term "doubly" refers to the fact that the node contains two (double) references. There is a reference to both the Next and Previous node in a doubly linked list.
Individual items/links that live in a linked list are referred to as nodes. Each link's data is stored in each node.
- Next - There is a property called Next on each node. The reference to the next node is stored in this property.
- Head - In a linked list, the Head is a type Node reference to the first node.
- Current - The Current is a type Node reference to the node currently being examined. To ensure that you start at the beginning of the linked list when traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head.
