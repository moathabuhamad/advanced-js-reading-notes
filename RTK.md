The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic.

It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
Redux requires too much boilerplate code

Redux Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit.

State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those.

Incredible performance based on a unique method for tracking of used/rendered and updated state segments. Ideal solution for huge states and very frequent updates.
